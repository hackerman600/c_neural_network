# c_neural_network
This is a neural network created using c from scratch. I wrote all the calculus equations out. I did not implement a training algorithim, however I placed the algorithim using mathematic inside the file. The purpose of this project was to take my c coding skills to a higher level. I have come to the conclusion that c is most definitely the most unpreferred language to use when dealing with matricies and vectors in my option. I am still able to get it done its just not the most effecient way to do it so I would pick c++ as it comes with the Eigen/Dense library. This allows me to effeciently do all matrix operations in fractions of the time. Choosing the right laguage for the job is something I learnt in this project. I implemented the mathematics I place in this file in C++ so there was no point ineffeciently repeating it, to find it just look for logistic regression algorithim.
